## 🔐 Step 1: Configure Jenkins Credentials

### Why These Are Needed:
- **Docker Hub**: To pull the student's pre-built Flask image
- **AWS**: To provision EC2 infrastructure in your account

### How to Add Credentials:

#### Navigate to Credentials Page
```
Jenkins Dashboard 
  → Manage Jenkins 
  → Manage Credentials 
  → System 
  → Global credentials (unrestricted)
  → Add Credentials
```

---

### Credential 1: Docker Hub Login

**Purpose**: Allow Jenkins to pull/push images from Docker Hub

```
Click "Add Credentials"

Field Values:
- Kind: Username with password
- Scope: Global (Jenkins, nodes, items, all child items, etc)
- Username: <your-docker-hub-username>
- Password: <your-docker-hub-password>
- ID: dockerhub-credentials
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ MUST BE EXACTLY THIS
- Description: Docker Hub Access for Student Project

Click "Create"
```

**Important**: The ID **must** be `dockerhub-credentials` because the Jenkinsfile references this exact ID.

---

### Credential 2: AWS Access Key ID

**Purpose**: Authenticate with AWS for Terraform

```
Click "Add Credentials"

Field Values:
- Kind: Secret text
- Scope: Global
- Secret: <paste-your-aws-access-key-id-here>
         Example: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
- ID: aws-access-key-id
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ MUST BE EXACTLY THIS
- Description: AWS Access Key for Terraform

Click "Create"
```

---

### Credential 3: AWS Secret Access Key

**Purpose**: Complete AWS authentication

```
Click "Add Credentials"

Field Values:
- Kind: Secret text
- Scope: Global
- Secret: <paste-your-aws-secret-access-key-here>
         Example: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
- ID: aws-secret-access-key
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ MUST BE EXACTLY THIS
- Description: AWS Secret Key for Terraform

Click "Create"
```

---

### Verify All Credentials Are Added

Your credentials page should now show:

```
Name                        Kind             ID
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Docker Hub Access...        Username/Pass    dockerhub-credentials
AWS Access Key...           Secret text      aws-access-key-id
AWS Secret Key...           Secret text      aws-secret-access-key
```

---

## 🏗️ Step 2: Create Jenkins Pipeline Job

### Create New Item
```
1. From Jenkins Dashboard, click "New Item" (top left)

2. Enter item name: Student-Flask-AWS-Project
   (you can name it anything you like)

3. Select: "Pipeline"

4. Click "OK"
```

---

### Configure the Pipeline

In the configuration page:

#### General Section
```
☐ Discard old builds (optional, but recommended)
  - Strategy: Log Rotation
  - Max # of builds to keep: 5
```

#### Build Triggers Section
```
☐ Skip this - we'll trigger manually
```

#### Advanced Project Options
```
☐ Skip this
```

#### Pipeline Section

**This is the important part!**

```
Definition: Pipeline script from SCM

SCM: Git

Repositories:
  Repository URL: <git-url-provided-by-student>
  Example: https://github.com/yaelitrovnik/flask-aws-monitor.git
  
  Credentials: - none -
  (unless the repo is private)

Branches to build:
  Branch Specifier: */main
  (or */master, depending on repo)

Script Path: Jenkinsfile
             ^^^^^^^^^^ This tells Jenkins where to find the pipeline code
```

Click "Save"

---

## ▶️ Step 3: Run the Pipeline

### First Build
```
1. From the project page, click "Build with Parameters"
   (if you don't see this, click "Build Now" instead)

2. You'll see a parameter field:
   
   DOCKER_USER: [yaelitrovnik    ]
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^
   This is the student's Docker Hub username
   
   IMPORTANT: Leave this as "yaelitrovnik" to use the student's 
   pre-built image. This way you don't need to build the image yourself.

3. Click "Build"
```

---

## 📊 Step 4: Monitor the Build

### Console Output
```
1. Click on the build number (e.g., "#1") in Build History

2. Click "Console Output"

3. Watch the stages execute:
   ✓ Clone Repository
   ✓ Parallel Quality Checks
     ├─ Linting
     └─ Security Scan
   ✓ Build Docker Image
   ✓ Push to Docker Hub
   ✓ Deploy Infrastructure (Terraform)
```

### Expected Timeline
```
Stage                          Duration
─────────────────────────────────────────
Clone Repository              10-20 sec
Parallel Quality Checks       30-45 sec
Build Docker Image            1-2 min
Push to Docker Hub            30-60 sec
Deploy Infrastructure         2-3 min
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total                         ~5 minutes
```

---

## 🎯 Step 5: Access the Dashboard

### Get the URL

At the end of the build, look for this output:

```
Apply complete! Resources: 4 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

instance_id = "i-0abcd1234efgh5678"
instance_name = "JBP-Builder-Instance"
instance_public_ip = "3.145.112.89"
private_key_path = "./builder_key.pem"
security_group_id = "sg-0123456789abcdef"
web_dashboard_url = "http://3.145.112.89:5001"
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                     THIS IS YOUR DASHBOARD URL
```

### Open the Dashboard

1. Copy the `web_dashboard_url`
2. Paste it in your browser
3. You should see a beautiful purple-gradient dashboard showing:
   - Public IP Address
   - SSH Key Location
   - Security Group ID
   - Instance Type (t3.medium)
   - AWS Region (us-east-2)
   - VPC ID

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Credential not found: dockerhub-credentials"

**Cause**: Credential ID doesn't match exactly

**Solution**:
1. Go to Jenkins → Manage Jenkins → Credentials
2. Click on "dockerhub-credentials" (or whatever you named it)
3. Click "Update"
4. Ensure ID field shows: `dockerhub-credentials`
5. Click "Save"

---

### Issue 2: "Error: UnauthorizedOperation - Not authorized to perform..."

**Cause**: AWS credentials lack necessary permissions

**Solution**:
Your AWS user needs these IAM permissions:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "ec2:RunInstances",
      "ec2:TerminateInstances",
      "ec2:DescribeInstances",
      "ec2:CreateSecurityGroup",
      "ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress",
      "ec2:CreateKeyPair",
      "ec2:DescribeKeyPairs",
      "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
      "ec2:CreateTags"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
  }]
}
```

---

### Issue 3: "Error acquiring the state lock"

**Cause**: Another Terraform process is running

**Solution**:
Wait 5 minutes and try again, OR:
```bash
# SSH into Jenkins server
cd /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/Student-Flask-AWS-Project/terraform
terraform force-unlock <LOCK_ID>
# Lock ID will be shown in the error message
```

---

### Issue 4: Dashboard shows "Metadata Service Unavailable"

**Cause**: Container can't reach AWS metadata service

**Solution**:
1. SSH into EC2 instance:
   ```bash
   # Get private key from Terraform output directory
   chmod 400 ./builder_key.pem
   ssh -i ./builder_key.pem ubuntu@<public-ip>
   ```

2. Check Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   docker logs flask-dashboard
   ```

3. Verify IMDSv2 is working:
   ```bash
   TOKEN=$(curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600")
   curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4
   ```

---

### Issue 5: "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon"

**Cause**: Docker not running on Jenkins server

**Solution**:
```bash
# SSH into Jenkins server
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
```

## 🧹 Cleanup After Testing

To avoid AWS charges after reviewing:

### Option 1: Destroy via Jenkins

```
1. In Jenkins, go to the project
2. Click "Configure"
3. Add a new stage to Jenkinsfile temporarily:
   
   stage('Cleanup') {
       steps {
           script {
               dir('terraform') {
                   sh 'terraform destroy -auto-approve'
               }
           }
       }
   }
4. Save and run pipeline
```

### Option 2: Manual Cleanup

```bash
# SSH into Jenkins server
cd /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/<job-name>/terraform
terraform destroy -auto-approve

# Or from your local machine if you have Terraform:
cd terraform
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

### Option 3: AWS Console

```
1. Go to AWS Console → EC2
2. Select the instance (Name: "JBP-Builder-Instance")
3. Actions → Instance State → Terminate
4. Also delete:
   - Security Group: jenkins-project-sg
   - Key Pair: builder_key
```
